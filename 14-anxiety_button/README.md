# Anxiety Button

An interactive web application featuring a button that reacts to cursor proximity.

## Overview

This project demonstrates a button that exhibits increasing levels of "anxiety" as the user's cursor approaches. It uses real-time distance calculations to trigger various states, messages, and behaviors.

## Behaviors

- Proximity Tracking: The button monitors the distance between the cursor and its center.
- Dynamic States: Changes appearance and messages based on five anxiety levels (Calm, Slightly Nervous, Nervous, Very Nervous, Panicking).
- Evasive Action: The button moves away from the cursor when the anxiety level reaches the panicking state.
- Interaction Effects: Includes micro-jitter animations, confetti on successful clicks, and a simulated system error screen.
