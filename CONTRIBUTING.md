## ✨ Ways to Contribute

### 1. Adding a New "Prank" Project
Got a funny idea for a button that reacts in an unexpected way? We'd love to have it!

*   **Create a new folder**: Name it with the next available number (e.g., `11-your_project_name`).
*   **Build your prank**: Use HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. Keep it simple and dependency-free if possible.
*   **Add a README**: Include a small `README.md` (or `.txt`) inside your folder explaining what the prank does.
*   **Update the main README**: Add your project to the list in the root [README.md](README.md) with a description and a link to the live preview.

### 2. Improving Existing Projects
See a bug or a way to make a prank even more annoying (in a fun way)? Feel free to submit a fix or improvement!

### 3. Documentation
Help us keep our docs clean! Whether it's the main README, this guide, or individual project descriptions, every bit helps.
